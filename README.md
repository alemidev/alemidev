I'm a Software Engineer, and I am constantly trying to improve my skills.

I love to challenge myself, and I'm always working on something (usually OSS on GitHub, but I also do some hardware). Thanks to this, I could develop my experience in various IT fields: be it Machine Learning, Embedded Development, Backend, Cyber Security or Distribuited Systems, I always found a project that would give me a problem to solve, and then studied and learned until I could overcome it.

I'm fascinated by the whole IT world, but especially from security, embedded or OS fields.

I love Linux, all my local and remote machines run some flavor of it. I am also familiar with the terminal and most CLI tools.

I try to take part to CyberSecurity challanges ("CTFs") when I can, and have some knowledge from the field.

I believe that code quality is a very important aspect and always try to make clean and maintainable source code. I enjoy reading other people's code: I can often learn new patterns from it.

For anything, don't hesitate to [leave a message](https://alemi.dev/suggestions/After%20checking%20my%20github,%20do%20you%20have%20any%20questions%3F) or get in touch <me@alemi.dev>
